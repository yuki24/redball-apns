# Redball::Apns [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yuki24/redball-apns.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yuki24/redball-apns)

Redball is a production-ready APNs (Apple Push Notifiaction Service) client.

 * **HTTP/2 done right**: The client ully utilizes HTTP/2's fantastic features, single persistent connection and multiplexing.
 * **Least needed dependency**: The only dependency the gem depends on is the [curb gem](https://github.com/taf2/curb), a wrapper around [libcurl](https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/), which has been installed on nearly a billion of machines and deviscs worldwide.
 * **Proper error handling**: Unlike other gems, the redball gem properly delegates connection errors to the thread that made a request rather than crashing the whole process or squashing.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'redball-apns'
